# StockPrediction
Prediction is done on the nifty50 dataset, first without using news sentiments and later integrating news sentiment scores in the model as features. The later shows better accuracy than the first model, which shows that sentiment features are helpful in prediction of the NIFTY, along with past trends.
Datasets used are companies listed on NSE.
